# Routing Beacons

RIS Route Collectors originate a small number of prefixes. These serve to better understand the state of the global BGP Internet routing system.

These prefixes can be divided into 2 types:
   * Anchor prefixes: #TODO explain
   * Beacon prefixes:

Special arrangements for routing beacons can be made XXX . An alternative for experiments with these types of set-ups is the [PEERING project](https://peering.ee.columbia.edu/).

We ask our peers to accept and propagate our anchor and beacon prefixes, and try to make an effort to have them seen globally, but it must be noted that
global visibility of these prefixes is not guaranteed.  XXX this is too vague?

# History
