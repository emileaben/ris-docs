# Route collectors

Route collectors are the physical machines where RIS ingests routing data.

Or route collectors have names that start with 'RRC' and end with a number. Starting at 00 and (as of this writing) up to 26.
We typically add a small number of route collectors every year.

Locations are also available in dns LOC records
